## Questions

I've seen trinket markup in Think Java 2, but Trinket's [FAQ](https://trinket.io/faq) states that the supported languages are: Python, Blocks, HTML5, and GlowScript...

Where does the \java command come from? I see this defintion in thinkjava.tex: `\newcommand{\java}{\verb}%}`. What should I do to make something similar for Go code?
