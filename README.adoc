# Think Go

Remix of https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkPython2[_Think Python 2e_] and https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkJava[_Think Java 2e_] by Allen Downey and Chris Mayfield for the Go programming language.

## This project is in a very early stage.

While this project is not a secret, there's no point in making it widely known at this time, because there's very little content for its target audience.

## Content creation via AsciiDoc

We are writing _Think Go_ using *AsciiDoc*. This is the same notation as was used for https://github.com/fluentpython[_Fluent Python_], and a departure from *LaTeX*, which Downey and Mayfield used in their books. This decision was made due to the authors' familiarity with *AsciiDoc*.

*AsciiDoc* was also chosen over *ReStructuredText* (*ReST*) and *Markdown*. *AsciiDoc* is more expressive than the other two, has friendlier syntax than *ReST*, and supports standard frontmatter and backmatter book sections (dedication, preface, bibliography, glossary, index, colophon) plus footnotes and index entries. *AsciiDoc* does support UTF-8, despite its misleading name.

The https://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoctor] toolchain in *Ruby* renders AsciiDoc in multiple formats. *AsciiDoctor* is more actively maintained than https://github.com/asciidoc[asciidoc], which had no releases from 2014 to 2016 and is still using *Python 2* in 2018.

For writing, Luciano is using the *Atom* editor with the https://atom.io/packages/asciidoc-assistant[AsciiDoc Assistant] package -- though he had to install its sub-packages one by one -- while Greg is using the *VSCode* editor with the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joaompinto.asciidoctor-vscode[AsciiDoc] package. To preview in another window, we use the *Asciidoctor.js Live Preview* add-on for https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/asciidoctorjs-live-preview/[Firefox] and for https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/asciidoctorjs-live-previe/iaalpfgpbocpdfblpnhhgllgbdbchmia?hl=en[Chrome].
