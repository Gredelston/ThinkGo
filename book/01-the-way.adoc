The goal of this book is to teach you to think like a computer
scientist. This way of thinking combines some of the best features of
mathematics, engineering, and natural science. Like mathematicians,
computer scientists use *formal languages* to denote ideas (specifically
computations). Like engineers, they design things, assembling components
into systems and evaluating trade-offs among alternatives. Like
scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form
hypotheses, and test predictions.

The single most important skill for a computer scientist is *problem
solving*. Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think
creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and
accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an
excellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills. That’s why
this chapter is called, "`The way of the program`".

On one level, you will be learning to program, a useful skill by itself.
On another level, you will use programming as a means to an end. As we
go along, that end will become clearer.


[[what-is-a-program]]
=== What is a program?

A *program* is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform
a computation. The computation might be something mathematical, such as
solving a system of equations or finding the roots of a polynomial, but
it can also be a symbolic computation, such as searching and replacing
text in a document or something graphical, like processing an image or
playing a video.

The details look different in different languages, but five basic
operations appear in just about every language:

input::
  Get data from the keyboard, a file, the network, a camera, or some
  other device like a fingerprint reader.
output::
  Display data on the screen, save it in a file, send it over the
  network, or control a device such as a door lock.
math::
  Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and
  multiplication.
conditional execution::
  Check for certain conditions to determine whether to perform some
  operation. For example: if the fingerprint matches, unlock the door.
repetition::
  Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.

Believe it or not, that’s pretty much all there is to it. Every program
you’ve ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of instructions
that look pretty much like these. So you can think of programming as the
process of breaking a large, complex task into smaller and smaller
subtasks until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with one
of these basic instructions.


[[running-go]]
=== Running Go

One challenge of getting started with Go is that you might have to install Go
and related software on your computer. If you are familiar with your operating
system, and especially if you are comfortable with the command-line interface,
you will have no trouble installing Go. But it can be distracting to learn about
system administration and programming at the same time.

To avoid that problem, we recommend that you start out running Go through a
browser. The https://play.golang.org/[Go Playground] lets you type or paste a Go
program and click a button to run it, without installing anything. The playground
is limited in many ways, but good enough to get started. After you’ve taken the
first steps, we’ll provide instructions for installing Go on your
computer.footnote:[If you can’t wait to install Go, Appendix A explains how.]


[[first-program]]
=== The first program

Traditionally, the first program you write when learning a new programming
language is called the hello world program. All it does is display the words
"`Hello, World!`" on the screen. In Go, it looks like this:

[[lst-hello-go]]
.`hello.go`
[source,go]
----
include::{sourcedir}hello/hello.go[]
----

We typed the <<lst-hello-go>> program and saved it in the playground. Follow
this link to see it:

https://tgo.li/2r8yCXj

If you open that address in a browser, you’ll see a page similar to
<<fig-play-hello>>.

[[fig-play-hello, The Go Playground]]
.The Go Playground: the `hello.go` program after running (note output at bottom).
image::play-hello.png[Screenshot of the Go Playground with the hello.go program listing and output.]

To execute the program, click the blue button labeled *Run*. You may briefly see
the message "`Waiting for remote server…"`, and then the output will appear
below the program listing, as pictured. Note that the output does not include
the quotation marks around "`Hello, World!`" .

We want to invite you to edit <<lst-hello-go>>, but we need words to describe
parts of a program so we can talk about it. The next section covers some basic
terms.


[[program-structure]]
=== Program structure

Go programs are made up of *declarations*. Every Go declaration starts with a
*keyword*: special words that exist to structure a Go program, like the bones of
a vertebrate. Because they are special, many program editors display keywords in
a distinctive color or in `*bold*` type.

In listing <<lst-hello-go>> we have three declarations: `*package*`, `*import*`,
and `*func*`. We’ll have a lot more to say about those declarations, but
basically this is what they mean:

`*package*`::
  All Go programs are organized in *packages*, which consist of one or more
  files with the `.go` extension. The package name `main` is mandatory for
  stand-alone programs — as opposed to *library packages* that are not complete
  programs, but provide functions for use by other programs.
`*import*`::
  This declaration tells Go which library packages are needed to build the
  program. This program uses only the `fmt` package, which provides text
  formatting and output functionality.
`*func*`::
  This declares a *function*, which is a sequence of instructions that
  perform some computation or action. The only function in <<lst-hello-go>>
  is named `main`. The `main` function uses the `fmt.Println` function. That's
  why we needed to import the `fmt` package.

A `.go` file can have several `*func*` declarations, but only one `*package*`
declaration. We'll see in XXX that only one `*import*` declaration is necessary.

Programming in Go is mostly about writing functions. We'll say more about
functions right after the exercises--and Chapter XXX is entirely
devoted to them. For now, let's focus on the overall program structure.


[[exercises-1-1]]
=== Exercises

It is a good idea to read this book in front of a computer so you can try out
the examples as you go. In this exercise, we’ll use the _Go Playground_ to learn
about the structure of the <<lst-hello-go>> program.

Whenever you are experimenting with a new feature, you should try to make
mistakes. This kind of experiment helps you remember what you read; it also
helps when you are programming, because you get to know what the error messages
mean. It is better to make mistakes now and on purpose than later and
accidentally.

Start with <<lst-hello-go>> in the _Go Playground_ and make the changes
suggested here.

After each change, hit the *Run* button to see what happens. Pay special
attention to the error messages. Sometimes they will not be clear, especially
when you are just getting started. But it is important that you get in the
habit of reading the messages and trying to understand what they mean.

To recover the original program text, just visit that same address:

https://tgo.li/2r8yCXj

Try these changes:

. What happens when there is no `*package*` declaration?
. What if the package name is `banana` instead of `main`?
. Restore the program to its original state. Then remove all blank
lines and the whitespace to the left of `fmt.Println("Hello, World!")`.
Does the program still run? What happens when you click the *Format*
button?
. What happens when there is no `*import*` declaration? After trying to
run the program without the `*import*` line, check the box labeled
*Imports*, then click *Format* and try to explain what happens.
. There is only one line with text in `hello.go` that you can delete
without changing the behavior of the program. Which one? Can you guess its
purpose, since it does not affect the program?

The answer to that last question is in <<function-syntax>>.


[[formal-and-natural-languages]]
=== Formal and natural languages

The _Go Playground_ may seem too strict at first. Why does it care so much about
quotes, parenthesis, and lowercase versus uppercase letters? The reason is that
Go is a formal language, as opposed to the natural languages we use daily.

*Natural languages* are the languages people speak, such as English,
Chinese, and Portuguese. They were not designed by people (although people
try to impose some order on them); they evolved naturally.

*Formal languages* are languages that are designed by people for
specific applications. For example, the notation that mathematicians use
is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships
among numbers and symbols. Chemists use a formal language to represent
the chemical structure of molecules. And most importantly:

____
Programming languages are formal languages that have been designed to
express computations.
____

Formal languages tend to have strict *syntax* rules that govern the structure of
statements. For example, in mathematics the statement `3 + 3 = 6` has correct
syntax, but `3 + = 3 \$ 6` does not. In chemistry H~2~O is a syntactically
correct formula, but ~2~Zz is not.

Syntax rules come in two flavors, pertaining to *tokens* and structure. Tokens
are the basic elements of the language, such as words, numbers, and chemical
elements. One of the problems with `3 + = 3 \$ 6` is that `\$` is not a legal
token in mathematics (at least as far as we know). Similarly, ~2~Zz is not legal
because there is no element with the symbol Zz.

The second type of syntax rule pertains to the way tokens are combined. The
equation `3 += 3` is illegal because even though `+` and `=` are legal tokens,
you can’t have one right after the other. Similarly, in a chemical formula the
subscript comes after the element symbol, not before.

This is @ well-structured Engli$h sentence with invalid t*kens in it. This
sentence all valid tokens has, but invalid structure with.

When you read a sentence in English or a statement in a formal language, you
have to figure out the structure (although in a natural language you do this
subconsciously). This process is called *parsing*.

Although formal and natural languages have many features in common -- tokens,
structure, and syntax -- there are some differences:

ambiguity::
  Natural languages are full of ambiguity, which people deal with by using
  contextual clues and other information. Formal languages are designed to be
  nearly or completely unambiguous, which means that any statement has exactly
  one meaning, regardless of context.
redundancy::
  In order to make up for ambiguity and reduce misunderstandings, natural
  languages employ lots of redundancy. As a result, they are often verbose.
  Formal languages are less redundant and more concise.
literalness::
  Natural languages are full of idiom and metaphor. If we say, "`The
  penny dropped`", there is probably no penny and nothing droppingfootnote:[This idiom means that someone understood something after a period of confusion. It is a reference to old pay phones, operated by coins. The coin dropped when the connection was made.]. Formal languages mean exactly what they say.

Because we all grow up speaking natural languages, it is sometimes hard
to adjust to formal languages. The difference between formal and natural
language is like the difference between poetry and prose, but more so:

Poetry::
  Words are used for their sounds as well as for their meaning, and the
  whole poem together creates an effect or emotional response. Ambiguity
  is not only common but often deliberate.
Prose::
  The literal meaning of words is more important, and the structure
  contributes more meaning. Prose is more amenable to analysis than
  poetry but still often ambiguous.
Programs::
  The meaning of a computer program is unambiguous and literal, and can
  be understood entirely by analysis of the tokens and structure.

Formal languages are more dense than natural languages, so it takes longer to
read them. Also, the structure is important, so it is not always best to read
from top to bottom, left to right. For example, if a `.go` file has a `main`
function, that's where you should start reading the program--even if that is the
last function in the filefootnote:[Some languages require or encourage placing
the `main` function at the bottom of the file. Go doesn't care about the order
of function declarations. But many programmers are used to putting `main` below
all other functions anyway.]. With practice, you will learn to parse the program
in your head, identifying the tokens and interpreting the structure. The most
important tokens are the keywords: program structure is build around them.
Finally, the details matter. Small errors in spelling and punctuation, which you
can get away with in natural languages, can make a big difference in a formal
language.


[[function-syntax]]
=== Anatomy of a function

Let’s take a closer look at the syntax of `main` function from <<lst-hello-go>>:

[[lst-func-main,the main function]]
.The main function.
[source,go]
----
func main() {
    // display traditional greeting
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
----

Let's start with the line marked with `//`. When Go sees `//`, it ignores
everything from that point to the end of the line. That is a *comment*:
text explaining the program in human language. Comments have no effect on the
execution of the program, but they make it easier for other programmers (and
your future self) to understand what you meant to do.

Now take a look at the first line in <<lst-func-main>>. The `func` keyword is
followed by the function name. A program can have many functions, so we try to
give descriptive names to them. The name `main` is not descriptive, but is
special: the execution of a Go program begins and ends in the function called
`main`. Everything else that happens when the program runs depends on actions
started by `main`. In a `func` declaration, the pair of parenthesis `()` is
required -- even when there's nothing inside them. We'll see what they are for
in chapter XXX.

Every function has a body: a block of lines delimited by curly braces `{` and `}`.
The lines in the body should be indented from the left margin to make it easy to
see where it starts and ends. In Go, the opening brace `{`  must be placed in
the same line as the keyword that starts the block, i.e. the `func` keyword in
this case. For example, this is wrong:

[source,go]
.Broken Go program: the `{` is misplaced.
----
func main()
{   // WRONG: left brace should be in the same line as the func keyword
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
----

The second line in the body of main main is a *statement*, a line that performs
an action. A common way of performing actions is to call functions from library
packages. In <<lst-func-main>>, this statement executes the `fmt.Println`
function to display a message on the screen:

[source,go]
----
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
----

The name `Println` stands for "`print line`". Confusingly, programmers use the
word _print_ to mean both "`display on the screen`" and "`send to the
printer`"footnote:[The confusion comes from the 1950's, when computers had no
screens, only https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter[teleprinters] attached
to them.]. In this book, we’ll try to say "`display`" when a function outputs to
the screen.

Go is "`case-sensitive`", which means that uppercase and lowercase letters are
considered different. In this example, `Println` has precisely one uppercase
letter; `println` and `PRINTLN` won’t work.

=== Exercises

Once again, start with <<lst-hello-go>> in the _Go Playground_ and make the
changes suggested here. To recover the original program text, just visit that
same URL:

[[hi-lo-level-languages]]
=== High and low-level programming languages

We've seen that formal languages are designed for specific purposes. For
programming, there are *low-level languages* and *high-level languages*.

Go is a high-level language, which means it was designed to be easy to read by
humans. Most high-level languages use English words and familiar symbols like `+`
and `=` as part of their syntax. Other high-level languages you may have heard
of include Java, JavaScript, Python, C, and PHPfootnote:[Java and JavaScript are
very different languages related only by name, for misguided marketing reasons.
Some say that Java and Javascript are similar like like "`car`" and "`carpet`"
are similar.].

In contrast, at the very low end of the scale there is *machine code*, which
consists of numeric instruction codes that a computer can execute directly. The
<<lst-func-main-hex>> below is the `main` function from <<lst-hello-go>> written
in machine code for an Intel-compatible machine of the year 2018:

The first computer programmers did manage to write and read programs in machine
code, until https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Booth[Kathleen Booth]
invented the first *assembly language*, a more readable notation for low-level
programming. This is how the <<lst-func-main-hex>> looks like in assembly
languagefootnote:[We used the excellent https://www.hopperapp.com/[Hopper
Disassembler] app to extract the code shown in <<lst-func-main-hex>> and produce
the <<lst-func-main-assembly>>.]:

Kathleen Booth also designed the first *assembler* -- a program that reads
assembly language and generates machine code automatically.

Although assembly language is easier to read than machine code, it's still
low-level because the instructions are very primitive and closely tied to a
specific machine model. For example, early computers didn't have built-in
instructions to perform multiplication -- so they had to be written in assembly
as a sequence of additions, similar to the long multiplication method we learn
in school.

Another pioneering programmer, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper[Grace
Hopper], created the first *compiler*: a program that can read a program
written in a high-level language and write and equivalent program in machine
code. Since then, we are able to write `x / y` and the compiler then generates
all the machine code instructions needed to divide two numbers in one specific
computer.

Today, only parts of very specialized programs are written in assembly language,
and no one writes machine code by hand -- unless they want to show off.

As you learn to think like a computer scientist, you'll meet some very
powerful ideas. This is one:

____
We can write programs that translate programs from one language to another.
____

When we program in a language that needs to be translated to run, the text we
write is called the *source code*. Listing <<lst-hello-go>> is an example of
source code.

The next section will show a program that will only work correctly if you run it
on your machine instead of the _Go Playground_.

[[time-now]]
=== What time is it?

The command shell on your computer probably has a command to tell you the
current time. In the bash shell (GNU/Linux or Mac OS) and on PowerShell
(Windows), the command is called `date`. Open the terminal and try it:

----
$ date
Sun Mar 25 20:19:21 UTC 2018
----

<<lst-now>> is a similar program, written in Go:

[[lst-now]]
.`now.go`
[source,go]
----
include::{sourcedir}now/now.go[]
----

Compared to <<lst-hello-go>>, <<lst-now>> introduces two new features:

. The `import` declaration now mentions two packages: `fmt` and `time`. When we
need more than one package, they must written one per line in a list delimited
by parenthesis (compare with <<lst-hello-go>>).
. In the second call to `fmt.Println`, instead of displaying a fixed text we use
the `time.Now()` function to retrieve the current time.

You can see the <<lst-now>> program in the playground at https://tgo.li/2rpsSst,
but you will be disappointed: on the playground it will always say it is 11:00
PM, November 10, 2009footnote:[That's when Go was announced to the public.].

Our next task is to work around this problem.


[[running-go-programs-on-your-machine]]
=== Running Go programs on your machine

The _Go Playground_ imposes several limitations for security reasons and to keep
costs down. That's why <<lst-now>> always displays the same time there. The
playground also hides important concepts and actions, which this section
reveals.

Before it can run, Go source code must be translated to machine code by the
compiler that is part of the Go installation.

In this book we’ll use two command-line Go tools to compile programs:

`*go build*`::
  This command reads the `.go` files in the current directory. If a package
  called `main` is found, the files are compiled to produce an executable file.
  You then use the OS shell to run that file.
`*go run* __myprogram.go__`::
  If the file `myprogram.go` declares a package `main`, it is compiled to a
  temporary directory and immediately executed. No new file is created in the
  current directory.

The `go build` command requires an extra step to run the program, but on the
other hand it gives you a stand-alone executable file that does not depend on
having the Go tools installed, so it can easily be distributed.


[[building-an-executable]]
=== Building and running an executable

When we run `go build`, an executable file is created with the same name as the
current directory (an `.exe` extension is added if you are on Windows).

This is how running <<lst-now>> looks like on the bash shell installed by
default on GNU/Linux and Mac OS X machines:

----
…/now$ ls <1>
now.go
…/now$ go build <2>
…/now$ ls <3>
now     now.go
…/now$ ./now <4>
This machine believes it's now:
2018-03-18 21:12:08.34314028 -0300 -03 m=+0.000422650
----
<1> List files in current directory. Only the source file is there.
<2> Compile program in the current directory.
<3> List files again. Note the `now` file.
<4> Execute `now`.

On the Windows command prompt, it’s very similar:

----
C:\…\now>dir /b <1>
now.go

C:\…\now>go build <2>

C:\…\now>dir /b <3>
now.exe
now.go

C:\…\now>now <4>
This machine believes it's now:
2018-03-25 16:08:21.7005402 -0300 -03 m=+0.002002601
----
<1> List files in directory--`/b` for brief listing. Only `now.go` is there.
<2> Compile program in the current directory.
<3> List files again. Note the `now` file.
<4> Execute `now.exe`--it's OK to ommit the `.exe` part to run the program.

The process of building and running simple programs is reduced to one step
if you use the `go run` command. On the bash shell:

----
…/now$ go run now.go
This machine believes it's now:
2018-03-18 22:42:17.209165629 -0300 -03 m=+0.000340954
----

On Windows:

----
C:\…\now>go run now.go
This machine believes it's now:
2018-03-25 16:11:55.922444 -0300 -03 m=+0.002000401
----

This <<lst-now>> program is a bit more interesting than <<lst-hello-go>>: at
least on your machine it should display a different time each time it runs.
In the next exercise will you will build a more interesting variation, the
simplest text-based "`animated`" clock we could imagine in Go.


[[exercises-1-3]]
=== Exercises

==== Trying and failing in the playground

Listing <<lst-now2>> shows a program that the _Go Playground_ refuses to run.

[[lst-now2]]
.`now2.go`
[source,go]
----
include::{sourcedir}now2/now2.go[]
----

Visit that code in https://tgo.li/2GieQiH click the *Run* button to
see what happens.

However, you can compile and run <<lst-now2>> on your machine using the `go
run` or `go build` commands. That's next.


==== Using `go run`

We will explain all details of <<lst-now2>> in XXX. Now the goal is to
practice compiling and running the program.

To execute <<lst-now2>> with `go run` on your machine, follow these steps:

. Create a folder on your computer named `now2`.
. Use your editor to create a file `now2.go` in the forever folder.
. Paste the source code of <<lst-now2>> in the `now2.go` file you just
  created. Save it.
. Using the command-line, navigate to the `now2` folder.
. Type the command `go run now2.go` to build and execute the program.
. To interrupt the program, use the keyboard combination kbd:[Ctrl+C].

Can you explain why the _Go Playground_ refuses to run this program?


==== Using `go build`

After completing the previous exercise, you can compile <<lst-now2>> with
`go build` doing this:

. Type the command `go build`. This creates the `now2` executable file
  (`now2.exe` on Windows).
. Run the `now` or `now2.exe` executable. See examples below.
. To interrupt the program, use the keyboard combination kbd:[Ctrl+C].

Here is how to run `forever` on the Mac OS X or GNU/Linux bash shell:

----
…/now$ ./now2
???
^C
----

On the Windows command prompt, `now2.exe` is executed like this--note that
you may omit the `.exe` extension to run the program:

----
C:\…\now> now2
???
^C
----

The output will not be `???`--we don't want to spoil the exercise for you. The
`^C` is how the shell displays the kbd:[Ctrl+C] combination.

=== Repetition: first take

In <<what-is-a-program>> we saw that one of the five basic operations every
language allows is output: that's all that <<lst-hello-go>> and <<lst-now>> do.
But <<lst-now2b>> shows another basic operation: repetition. That's the purpose
of the `for` keyword:

[[lst-now2b]]
.`main` from `now2.go`
[source,go]
----
func main() {
	for {  <1>
		fmt.Println(time.Now())  <2>
		time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)  <3>
	}
}
----
<1> Repeat the two statements in the enclosed block forever.
<2> Display the current time.
<3> Pause for one second.

Note that the `for` keyword is followed by a block of code inside a pair of
braces `{…}`. In <<function-syntax>> we talked about the function body, which
is the block that holds the statements inside a `func` declaration--also
delimited by braces. In <<lst-now2b>> the body of the `main` function contains
a single `for` statement, but that statement has its own block of statements
with two lines: one with `fmt.Println`, the other with `time.Sleep`. In
computing, nested structures are quite common: you'll get used to seeing blocks
inside blocks inside other blocks.

The `for` statement in Go executes the statements in its block repeatedly. There
are a few variations of `for` but the simplest one is shown in <<lst-now2b>>:
`for {…}` repeats the block "`forever`"footnote:[In practice "`forever`" means
until you interrupt the program with kbd:[Ctrl+C], or some other disruption
affects the program or the computer itself--for example, Windows decides to
restart to install the latest updates).

To make our program pause for a moment, we use `time.Sleep(…)`, which requires a
numeric argument specifying the duration of the pause. The unit used by
`time.Sleep` is the nanosecond, or 10^-9^ (^1^/~1.000.000.000~). For
convenience, you can multiply the duration by one of the special values defined
in the `time` package, such as `time.Hour`, `time.Second`, or
`time.Millisecond`footnote[See
https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Duration[`time.Duration`] in the Go documentation
for a list of predefined duration values.].

.The edit-test dance
****

Programmers spend a lot of time repeating these steps:

. Edit the source code.
. Test the code.
. Go back to editor and change something.
. Test the code again.
. Repeat until done.

TIP: A good way of doing the edit-test cycle is to have the editor in one window
and the terminal/console in another window, and alternate between them using the
shortcut for your system: kbd:[ALT+TAB] on Windows and GNU/Linux, or kbd:[⌘+TAB]
on MacOS. Also, use the kbd:[↑] (up arrow) to repeat commands on the command
line without typing them again.

Using the app switching shortcut on a Windows or GNU/Linux machine, the
edit-test dance becomes:

. Edit the source code.
. kbd:[ALT+TAB] to go to the terminal/console.
. kbd:[↑] to repeat the previous `go run forever.go` without typing it again.
. kbd:[ENTER] to run the command.
. kbd:[ALT+TAB] to go back to the editor.

In a short time you'll be good at this dance. The next exercise should help.

[[debugging]]
=== Debugging

Programmers make mistakes. For whimsical reasons, programming errors are called
*bugs* and the process of tracking them down is called *debugging*.

Programming, and especially debugging, sometimes brings out strong emotions. If
you are struggling with a difficult bug, you might feel angry, despondent, or
embarrassed.

There is evidence that people naturally respond to computers as if they were
people. When they work well, we think of them as teammates, and when they are
obstinate or rude, we respond to them the same way we respond to rude, obstinate
people (Reeves and Nass, _The Media Equation: How People Treat Computers,
Television, and New Media Like Real People and Places_).

Preparing for these reactions might help you deal with them. One approach is to
think of the computer as an employee with certain strengths, like speed and
precision, and particular weaknesses, like lack of empathy and inability to
grasp the big picture.

Your job is to be a good manager: find ways to take advantage of the strengths
and mitigate the weaknesses. And find ways to use your emotions to engage with
the problem, without letting your reactions interfere with your ability to work
effectively.

Learning to debug can be frustrating, but it is a valuable skill that is useful
for many activities beyond programming. At the end of each chapter there is a
section, like this one, with my suggestions for debugging. we hope they help!
