== The way of the program
:imagesdir: ../img/01/
:sourcedir: ../code/01/

The goal of this book is to teach you to think like a computer
scientist. This way of thinking combines some of the best features of
mathematics, engineering, and natural science. Like mathematicians,
computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas (specifically
computations). Like engineers, they design things, assembling components
into systems and evaluating trade-offs among alternatives. Like
scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form
hypotheses, and test predictions.

The single most important skill for a computer scientist is *problem
solving*. Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think
creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and
accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an
excellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills. That’s why
this chapter is called, "`The way of the program`".

On one level, you will be learning to program, a useful skill by itself.
On another level, you will use programming as a means to an end. As we
go along, that end will become clearer.

[[what-is-a-program]]
=== What is a program?

A *program* is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform
a computation. The computation might be something mathematical, such as
solving a system of equations or finding the roots of a polynomial, but
it can also be a symbolic computation, such as searching and replacing
text in a document or something graphical, like processing an image or
playing a video.

The details look different in different languages, but a few basic
operations appear in just about every language:

input::
  Get data from the keyboard, a file, the network, a camera, or some
  other device like a fingerprint reader.
output::
  Display data on the screen, save it in a file, send it over the
  network, or control a device such as a door lock.
math::
  Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and
  multiplication.
conditional execution::
  Check for certain conditions to determine whether to perform some
  operation. For example: if the fingerprint matches, unlock the door.
repetition::
  Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.

Believe it or not, that’s pretty much all there is to it. Every program
you’ve ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of instructions
that look pretty much like these. So you can think of programming as the
process of breaking a large, complex task into smaller and smaller
subtasks until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with one
of these basic instructions.

[[running-go]]
=== Running Go

One of the challenges of getting started with Go is that you might have
to install Go and related software on your computer. If you are familiar
with your operating system, and especially if you are comfortable with
the command-line interface, you will have no trouble installing Go. But
it can be distracting to learn about system
administration and programming at the same time.

To avoid that problem, we recommend that you start out running Go through a
browser. The https://play.golang.org/[Go Playground] lets you type or paste Go
code and click a button to run it, without installing anything. The playground
is limited in many ways, but good enough to get started. After you’ve taken the
first steps, we’ll provide instructions for installing Go on your
computer.footnote:[If you can’t wait to install Go, Appendix A explains how.]

[[first-program]]
=== The first program

Traditionally, the first program you write when learning a new
programming language is called the hello world program. All it does is
display the words "`Hello, World!`" on the screen. In Go, it looks like
this:

[[lst-hello-go]]
.`hello.go`
[source,go]
----
include::{sourcedir}hello/hello.go[]
----

We typed the <<lst-hello-go>> program and saved it in the playground. Follow this
link to see it:

https://tgo.li/2r8yCXj

If you open that address in a browser, you’ll see a page similar to
<<fig-play-hello>>.

[[fig-play-hello, The Go Playground]]
.The Go Playground: the `hello.go` program after running (note output at bottom).
image::play-hello.png[Screenshot of the Go Playground with the hello.go program listing and output.]

To execute the program, click the blue button labeled *Run*. You may
briefly see the message "`Waiting for remote server…"`, and then the
output will appear below the code listing, as pictured. Note that the
output does not include the quotation marks around "`Hello, World!`" .

We want to invite you to edit <<lst-hello-go>>, but we need words to describe parts
of a program so we can talk about it. The next section covers some basic terms.

[[program-structure]]
=== Program structure

Go programs are made up of *declarations*. Every Go declaration starts with a
*keyword*: special words that exist to structure a Go program, like the bones of
a vertebrate. Because they are special, many program editors display keywords in
a distinctive color or in `*bold*` type.

In listing <<lst-hello-go>> we have three declarations: `*package*`, `*import*`,
and `*func*`. We’ll have a lot more to say about those declarations, but
basically this is what they mean:

`*package*`::
  All Go code is organized in *packages*, which consist of one or more
  files with the `.go` extension. The package name `main` is mandatory for
  stand-alone programs — as opposed to *library packages* that are not complete
  programs, but provide functions for use by other programs.
`*import*`::
  This declaration tells Go which library packages are needed to build the
  program. This program uses only the `fmt` package, which provides text
  formatting and output functionality.
`*func*`::
  This declares a *function*, which is a sequence of instructions that
  perform some computation or action. The only function in <<lst-hello-go>>
  is named `main`. The `main` function uses the `fmt.Println` function. That's
  why we needed to import the `fmt` package.

A `.go` file can have several `*func*` declarations, but only one `*package*`
declaration. We'll see in XXX that only one `*import*` declaration is necessary.

Programming in Go is mostly about writing functions. We'll say more about
functions right after the exercises--and Chapter XXX is entirely
devoted to them. For now, let's focus on the overall program structure.


[[exercises]]
=== Exercises

It is a good idea to read this book in front of a computer so you can try out
the examples as you go. In this exercise, we’ll use the _Go Playground_ to learn
about the structure of the <<lst-hello-go>> program.

Whenever you are experimenting with a new feature, you should try to make
mistakes. This kind of experiment helps you remember what you read; it also
helps when you are programming, because you get to know what the error messages
mean. It is better to make mistakes now and on purpose than later and
accidentally.

Start with <<lst-hello-go>> in the _Go Playground_ and make the changes
suggested here.

After each change, hit the *Run* button to see what happens. Pay special
attention to the error messages. Sometimes they will not be clear, especially
when you are just getting started. But it is important that you get in the
habit of reading the messages and trying to understand what they mean.

To recover the original code, just visit that same address:

https://tgo.li/2r8yCXj

Try these changes:

. What happens when there is no `*package*` declaration?
. What if the package name is `banana` instead of `main`?
. Restore the program to its original state. Then remove all blank
lines and the whitespace to the left of `fmt.Println("Hello, World!")`.
Does the program still run? What happens when you click the *Format*
button?
. What happens when there is no `*import*` declaration? After trying to
run the program without the `*import*` line, check the box labeled
*Imports*, then click *Format* and try to explain what happens.
. There is only one line with text in `hello.go` that you can delete
without changing the behavior of the program. Which one? Can you guess its
purpose, since it does not affect the program?

The answer to that last question is in the next section.

[[function-syntax]]
=== Anatomy of a function

Let’s take a closer look at the `main` function from <<lst-hello-go>>:

[[lst-func-main,the main function]]
.The main function.
[source,go]
----
func main() {
    // display traditional greeting
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
----

Let's start with the line marked with `//`. When Go sees `//`, it ignores
everything from that point to the end of the line. That is a *comment*:
text explaining the code in human language. Comments have no effect on the
execution of the program, but they make it easier for other programmers (and
your future self) to understand what you meant to do.

Now take a look at the first line in <<lst-func-main>>. The `func` keyword is
followed by the function name. A program can have many functions, so we try to
give descriptive names to them. The name `main` is not descriptive, but is
special: the execution of a Go program begins and ends in the function called
`main`. Everything else that happens when the program runs depends on actions
started by `main`.

Every function has a body: a block of lines delimited by curly braces `{` and `}`.
The lines in the body should be indented from the left margin to make it easy to
see where it starts and ends. In Go, the opening brace `{`  must be placed in
the same line as the keyword that starts the block, i.e. the `func` keyword in
this case. For example, this is wrong:

[source,go]
.Broken Go program: the `{` is misplaced.
----
func main()
{   // WRONG: left brace should be in the same line as the func keyword
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
----

The second line in the body of main main is a *statement*, a line of code that
performs an action. A common way of performing actions is to call functions from
library packages. In <<lst-func-main>>, this statement calls the `fmt.Println`
function to display a message on the screen:

[source,go]
----
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
----

The name `Println` stands for "`print line`". Confusingly,  _print_ can mean
both "`display on the screen`" and "`send to the printer`" in programming. In
this book, we’ll try to say "`display`" when a function outputs to the screen.

Go is "`case-sensitive`", which means that uppercase and lowercase letters are
considered different. In this example, `Println` has precisely one uppercase
letter; `println` and `PRINTLN` won’t work.

=== Exercises

Once again, start with <<lst-hello-go>> in the _Go Playground_ and make the
changes suggested here. To recover the original code, just visit that same URL:

https://tgo.li/2r8yCXj

After each change, hit the *Run* button to see what happens. If you don't get
what you expect, pay attention to the error messages.

. Change the text of the function call `fmt.Println("Hello, World!")`,
removing one or both parenthesis.
. If you are trying to display a string, what happens if you leave out
one of the quotation marks, or both?
. Add another statement calling `fmt.Println("...")` below the first one, putting
your own text between the quotes.
. Write a program that displays the E. E. Cummings poem known as "`l(a"`

[[formal-and-natural-languages]]
=== Formal and natural languages

The _Go Playground_ may seem too strict at first. Why does it care so much about
quotes, parenthesis, and lowercase versus uppercase letters? The reason is that
Go is a formal language, as opposed to the natural languages we use daily.

*Natural languages* are the languages people speak, such as English,
Chinese, and Portuguese. They were not designed by people (although people
try to impose some order on them); they evolved naturally.

*Formal languages* are languages that are designed by people for
specific applications. For example, the notation that mathematicians use
is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships
among numbers and symbols. Chemists use a formal language to represent
the chemical structure of molecules. And most importantly:

_______________________________________________________________________
*Programming languages are formal languages that have been designed to
express computations.*
_______________________________________________________________________

Formal languages tend to have strict *syntax* rules that govern the structure of
statements. For example, in mathematics the statement `3 + 3 = 6` has correct
syntax, but `3 + = 3 \$ 6` does not. In chemistry H~2~O is a syntactically
correct formula, but ~2~Zz is not.

Syntax rules come in two flavors, pertaining to *tokens* and structure. Tokens
are the basic elements of the language, such as words, numbers, and chemical
elements. One of the problems with `3 + = 3 \$ 6` is that `\$` is not a legal
token in mathematics (at least as far as we know). Similarly, ~2~Zz is not legal
because there is no element with the symbol Zz.

The second type of syntax rule pertains to the way tokens are combined. The
equation `3 += 3` is illegal because even though `+` and `=` are legal tokens,
you can’t have one right after the other. Similarly, in a chemical formula the
subscript comes after the element symbol, not before.

This is @ well-structured Engli$h sentence with invalid t*kens in it. This
sentence all valid tokens has, but invalid structure with.

When you read a sentence in English or a statement in a formal language, you
have to figure out the structure (although in a natural language you do this
subconsciously). This process is called *parsing*.

Although formal and natural languages have many features in common -- tokens,
structure, and syntax -- there are some differences:

ambiguity::
  Natural languages are full of ambiguity, which people deal with by using
  contextual clues and other information. Formal languages are designed to be
  nearly or completely unambiguous, which means that any statement has exactly
  one meaning, regardless of context.
redundancy::
  In order to make up for ambiguity and reduce misunderstandings, natural
  languages employ lots of redundancy. As a result, they are often verbose.
  Formal languages are less redundant and more concise.
literalness::
  Natural languages are full of idiom and metaphor. If we say, "`The
  penny dropped`", there is probably no penny and nothing droppingfootnote:[This idiom means that someone understood something after a period of confusion. It is a reference to old pay phones, operated by coins. The coin dropped when the connection was made.]. Formal languages mean exactly what they say.

Because we all grow up speaking natural languages, it is sometimes hard
to adjust to formal languages. The difference between formal and natural
language is like the difference between poetry and prose, but more so:

Poetry::
  Words are used for their sounds as well as for their meaning, and the
  whole poem together creates an effect or emotional response. Ambiguity
  is not only common but often deliberate.
Prose::
  The literal meaning of words is more important, and the structure
  contributes more meaning. Prose is more amenable to analysis than
  poetry but still often ambiguous.
Programs::
  The meaning of a computer program is unambiguous and literal, and can
  be understood entirely by analysis of the tokens and structure.

Formal languages are more dense than natural languages, so it takes longer to
read them. Also, the structure is important, so it is not always best to read
from top to bottom, left to right. Instead, learn to parse the program in your
head, identifying the tokens and interpreting the structure. For example, if a
`.go` file has a `main` function, it is often useful to read it first. Finally,
the details matter. Small errors in spelling and punctuation, which you can get
away with in natural languages, can make a big difference in a formal language.


[[hi-lo-level-languages]]
=== High and low level programming languages

We've seen that formal languages are designed for specific purposes. For
programming, there are *low level languages* and *high level languages*. Go is a
high level language, which means it was designed to be easy to read by humans.
Most high level languages use English words and familiar math symbols like `+`
and `()` as part of their syntax.

In contrast, at the very low end of the scale there is *machine code*, which
consists of numeric instruction codes that a computer can execute directly.
The <<lst-func-main-hex>> below is the `main` function from <<lst-hello-go>>
written in machine code.

The first computer programmers (many of whom were women, by the way) did manage
to write and read programs in machine code, until Kathleen Booth invented
the first *assembly language*, a more readable notation for low level programming.

Although assembly is much easier to read than raw machine code, it's still low
level because the instructions are very primitive and closely tied to a specific
machine model. For example, early computers didn't have built-in instructions to
perform multiplication -- so they had to be written in machine code as a
sequence of additions, similar to the long multiplication method we learn in
grade-school.

Another pioneering programmer, Grace Hopper, changed that when she invented the
first *compiler*: a program that can read a program written in a high level
language and write and equivalent program in machine code. Since then, we are
able to write `x / y` and the compiler then generates all the machine code
instructions needed to divide two numbers in one specific computer.

Today, only small parts of very specialized programs are written in low level
languages, and no one writes machine code by hand -- unless they want to show
off.

As you learn to think like a computer scientist, you'll meet some very
powerful ideas. This is one:

[NOTE]
====
We can write programs that read programs and write other programs.
====

The next section will show how to use the Go compiler so you can build
programs without the limitations of the _Go Playground_.


[[running-go-programs-on-your-machine]]
=== Running Go programs on your machine

The _Go Playground_ imposes several limitations for security and cost reasons.
For example, the program in listing <<lst-now>> should tell you the current
time, but on the playground it will always claim it is 11:00 PM, November 10,
2009 -- the date when Go was announced to the
public. The <<lst-now>> program in the playground is at https://tgo.li/2rpsSst.

[[lst-now]]
.`now.go`
[source,go]
----
include::{sourcedir}now/now.go[]
----

The playground also automates and hides important concepts and actions,
which this section reveals.

Before they can run, programs written in Go must be translated into
"`machine language`", the low-level instructions that the computer can
follow. This translation is done by the Go *compiler*, one of the
software tools that is part of the Go installation.

The compiler reads `.go` text files—the *source code*—and produces binary
files that are executable. In this book we’ll use two command-line Go
tools to run our programs:

`*go build*`::
  This command reads the .go files in the current directory. If a
  package main is found, the files are compiled to produce an
  executable. You then use the OS shell to run the executable.
`*go run* __myprogram.go__`::
  If the file `myprogram.go` declares a package `main`, it is compiled to a
  temporary directory and immediately executed.

The go build command requires an extra step to run the program, but on the other
hand it gives you a stand-alone executable that does not depend on having the Go
tools installed, so it can easily be distributed.

[[building-an-executable]]
=== Building an executable

When we run `go build`, an executable file is created with the same name as the
current directory (an `.exe` extension is added if you are on Windows).

Once a program is compiled, you can execute it repeatedly without further
translation. As a result, compiled programs often run faster than interpreted
programs.

Figure [fig.compiler] shows the steps of the development process.

image:figs/compiler.png[The process of compiling and running a Go
program.]

The Go playground (shown in Figure [fig.playhello]) lets us use a Go compiler
running on a Google server machine. When you hit the *Run* button, the
playground Go compiler produces an executable and saves it in the server (if
there are no errors). The server then runs the executable, and sends its output
back to your browser. The executable is then discarded, so the Go playground is
useful only for quick experiments.

To compile Go programs locally, we need to install the Go distribution, as
explained in Appendix XXX. After Go is installed, you can use the go build in
the terminal.

The programmer writes source code in the file hello.go and uses go build to
compile it. If there are no errors, the compiler saves the executable in the
file hello (or hello.exe, in Windows). To run the program, the user simply
invokes it in the terminal. The output of the program is then displayed on the
screen.

This is how running hello.go looks like on the bash shell installed by default
on GNU/Linux and Mac OS X machines:

....
$ ./hello
Hello, World!
....

On the Windows command prompt, it’s very similar:

....
> hello.exe
Hello, World!
....

Although it might seem complicated, these steps are automated for you in most
program development environments. Usually you only have to press a button or
type a single command to compile and run your program. On the other hand, it is
important to know what steps are happening in the background, so if something
goes wrong you can figure out what it is.

[[debugging]]
=== Debugging

Programmers make mistakes. For whimsical reasons, programming errors are called
*bugs* and the process of tracking them down is called *debugging*.

Programming, and especially debugging, sometimes brings out strong emotions. If
you are struggling with a difficult bug, you might feel angry, despondent, or
embarrassed.

There is evidence that people naturally respond to computers as if they were
people. When they work well, we think of them as teammates, and when they are
obstinate or rude, we respond to them the same way we respond to rude, obstinate
people (Reeves and Nass, _The Media Equation: How People Treat Computers,
Television, and New Media Like Real People and Places_).

Preparing for these reactions might help you deal with them. One approach is to
think of the computer as an employee with certain strengths, like speed and
precision, and particular weaknesses, like lack of empathy and inability to
grasp the big picture.

Your job is to be a good manager: find ways to take advantage of the strengths
and mitigate the weaknesses. And find ways to use your emotions to engage with
the problem, without letting your reactions interfere with your ability to work
effectively.

Learning to debug can be frustrating, but it is a valuable skill that is useful
for many activities beyond programming. At the end of each chapter there is a
section, like this one, with my suggestions for debugging. we hope they help!

[[exercises-2]]
=== Exercises

It is a good idea to read this book in front of a computer so you can try out
the examples as you go.

Whenever you are experimenting with a new feature, you should try to make
mistakes. For example, in the "`Hello, world!`" program, what happens if you
leave out one of the quotation marks? What if you leave out both? What if you
spell print wrong?

This kind of experiment helps you remember what you read; it also helps when you
are programming, because you get to know what the error messages mean. It is
better to make mistakes now and on purpose than later and accidentally.

. In a print statement, what happens if you leave out one of the parentheses, or both?
. If you are trying to print a string, what happens if you leave out one of the quotation marks, or both?
. You can use a minus sign to make a negative number like -2. What happens if you put a plus sign before a number? What about 2++2?
. In math notation, leading zeros are ok, as in 02. What happens if
you try this in Python?
. What happens if you have two values with no operator between them?

Start the Python interpreter and use it as a calculator.

. How many seconds are there in 42 minutes 42 seconds?
. How many miles are there in 10 kilometers? Hint: there are 1.61 kilometers in a mile.
. If you run a 10 kilometer race in 42 minutes 42 seconds, what is your average pace (time per mile in minutes and seconds)? What is your average speed in miles per hour?
