From 1993 to 2017, the official street address of Apple's headquarters was One
Infinite Loop. This chapter explains why that address makes programmers smile.

We'll cover the bare minimum of repetition and conditional execution, while
building simple experiments of generative art--visual displays generated by
software that you'll study and tweak.

This is a lab chapter: you will see and edit code that may include Go language
features we haven't covered before. We'll study the behavior of the programs by
making changes and running them. Detailed explanations of the language features
used in the experiments will come in later chapters.


=== Clock experiments

We begin by enhancing XXX example from chapter 1.


==== Trying and failing in the playground

Listing <<lst-now2>> shows a program that the _Go Playground_ refuses to run.

[[lst-now2]]
.`now2.go`
[source,go]
----
include::{sourcedir}now2/now2.go[]
----

Visit that code in https://tgo.li/2GieQiH click the *Run* button to see what
happens.

However, you can compile and run <<lst-now2>> on your machine using the `go
run` or `go build` commands.

We will explain all details of <<lst-now2>> in <<repeat-forever>>.
Now the goal is to practice compiling and running the program.


==== Using `go run`

To execute <<lst-now2>> with `go run` on your machine, follow these steps:

. Create a folder on your computer named `now2`.
. Use your editor to create a file `now2.go` in the `now2` folder.
. Paste the source code of <<lst-now2>> in the `now2.go` file you just
  created. Save it.
. Using the command-line, navigate to the `now2` folder.
. Type the command `go run now2.go` to build and execute the program.
. To interrupt the program, use the keyboard combination kbd:[Ctrl+C].

Can you explain why the _Go Playground_ refuses to run this program?


==== Using `go build`

After completing the previous exercise, you can compile <<lst-now2>> with
`go build` doing this:

. Type the command `go build`. This creates the `now2` executable file
  (`now2.exe` on Windows).
. Run the `now` or `now2.exe` executable. See examples below.
. To interrupt the program, use the keyboard combination kbd:[Ctrl+C].

Here is how to run `now2` on the Mac OS X or GNU/Linux bash shell:

----
…/now2$ ./now2
«program output will appear here»
^C
----

Remember that on Windows PowerShell you don't need to type `./`--just `now2` is
enough to run the program.

In the previous listing, `^C` is how the shell displays the kbd:[Ctrl+C]
combination we use to interrupt the program.


[[repeat-forever]]
==== Repeat forever

===== Code overview

In <<what-is-a-program>> we saw that one of the five basic operations every
language allows is output: that's all that <<lst-hello-go>> and <<lst-now>> do.
But <<lst-now2b>> shows another basic operation: repetition. That's the purpose
of the `for` keyword:

[[lst-now2b]]
.`main` from `now2.go`
[source,go]
----
func main() {
	for {  // <1>
		fmt.Println(time.Now())  // <2>
		time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)  // <3>
	}
}
----
<1> Repeat the statements in the enclosed block forever.
<2> Display the current time.
<3> Pause for one second.

Note that the `for` keyword is followed by a block of code inside a pair of
braces `{…}`. In <<function-syntax>> we talked about the function body: the
brace-delimited block that holds the statements in a `func` declaration. In
<<lst-now2b>> the body of the function contains a single `for` statement, but
that statement has its own block of statements with two lines: one with
`fmt.Println`, the other with `time.Sleep`.

In computing, nested structures are very common. A picture may be useful:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll[Matryoshka dolls] are nested
structures in the real world. The structure of <<lst-now2>> is similar to this
picture:

[[fig-matryoshka, Russian Matryoshka dolls]]
.`func main` is the outer declaration. Inside it there is a `for` statement, which contains two statements.
image::matryoshka-labels.jpg["Two Matryoshka dolls split open, with the tops set aside and the bottoms nested. The bigger doll is labeled `func main`, the smaller is `for`. Inside the nested bottoms there are two labels: `fmt.Println` and `time.Sleep`."]

The `for` statement in Go executes the statements in its block repeatedly. There
are other, more common variations of `for`, but the simplest one is this: `for {…}`.
It repeats the enclosed block "`forever`".

To make our program pause for a moment, we use `time.Sleep(…)`, which requires a
numeric argument specifying the duration of the pause. The unit used by
`time.Sleep` is the nanosecond, or 10^-9^ (^1^/~1.000.000.000~)--so
`time.Sleep(5)` makes a very short pause of 5ns. For convenience, you can
multiply the duration by one of the special multipliers defined in the `time`
package, such as `time.Hour`, `time.Second`, or `time.Millisecond`.footnote:[See
https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Duration[`time.Duration`] in the Go documentation
for a list of predefined duration values.]

===== Code changes

====== Make the updates faster or slower

We've seen that the `time.Sleep(…)` function call inserts the delay between each
time displayed. Change the argument (whatever is inside the parenthesis) to make
the updates slower. Then change it to make the updates faster. For example, try
a delay of 20 milliseconds. Remember that kbd:[Ctrl+C] interrupts the program,
even if it seems to be frozen.

====== Change the display

Change the first statement in the `for` block from `fmt.Println` to `fmt.Print`.
Can you explain the result? Try the code with a 3 second delay so you can see in
detail what is happening.

How is that behavior related to the function names `Println` and `Print`?

You can add text and spaces to the output of `Println` and `Print` by adding
more quoted parameters inside the parenthesis. For example:

[source,go]
----
		fmt.Print(time.Now(), " | ")  // separate displays with a "pipe"
----

Experiment `Print`, with a 20 millisecond delay, and change the width of the
terminal window while the program is running. You will see patterns emerging.
That's the inspiration for the artsy experiments we will to next.


=== Text pattern experiments

Many of us who started programming around 1980 played with a family of programs
called "Ten-Print Goto-Ten". That's a reference to programs in the BASIC
language similar to this one:

[source,BASIC]
----
10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10
----

That's a complete BASIC program from the age when program lines had to be
numberedfootnote:[We numbered lines in increments of 10 to avoid the chore of
renumbering the whole program when inserting new lines using the primitive line
editor ]. The line has two BASIC instructions: `PRINT` and `GOTO`, separated by
a colon according to the BASIC syntax rules. The `GOTO 10` instruction tells the
computer to jump to line 10, so the `PRINT` instruction is repeated forever.

To run that program, you need a vintage Commodore 64 computer, or a software
**emulator** like VICE (XXX link). The output is impressive, for a one line
program. See [[fig-maze-commodore]].

[[fig-maze-commodore, Commodore 64 emulator screen shot.]]
.Maze drawing BASIC program running in the VICE C64 emulator.
image::maze-c64.png["Picture of a maze drawing program running in the VICE C64 emulator."]

We will skip the details about the expression after the `PRINT`. It's enough to
say that it randomly picks one of two characters to display: `╱` or `╲`.

The maze drawing one-liner is such a classic that decades later it inspired an
entire book about computer generated art.footnote:[The book is XXX]. In the next
experiments we will play with programs that generate patterns on the screen,
including one that draws mazes similar to [[fig-maze-commodore]].


==== Ego trip

Before discovering the maze drawing program, lots of newbie coders went on an
ego trip writing programs to fill the display with their names, like this one:

[[lst-forever]]
.`forever.go`
[source,go]
----
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	for {
		fmt.Print("J. Random Hacker ")
		time.Sleep(5 * time.Millisecond)
	}
}
----

Run the program. Change the width of the terminal window as it runs.

Do you know why there is a trailing space in the quoted parameter to the
`fmt.Print` function?

Replace that parameter with your name or any words you want, always keeping the
quotes around the text. Note the different patterns that emerge depending on
the terminal width and the length of the text displayed.

Try making patterns with special graphic characters like these:

[[assorted-draw-chars]]
.Assorted drawing characters.
----
░ ▒ ▓ █ ▄ ■ ▀ ·
│ ─ ┐ └ ┘ ┌ ┼ ┤ ├ ┴ ┬
║ ═ ╗ ╚ ╝ ╔ ╬ ╣ ╠ ╩ ╦
╱ ╲
----

TIP: You will not find any of these characters on a standard keyboard, but you
can copy & paste them from here if you are reading this on a screen.

[[edit-test-dance,edit-test dance]]
.The edit-test dance
****

Programmers spend a lot of time repeating these steps:

. Edit the source code.
. Test the code.
. Go back to editor and change something.
. Test the code again.
. Repeat until done.

TIP: A good way of doing the edit-test cycle is to have the editor in one window
and the terminal/console in another window, and alternate between them using the
shortcut for your system: kbd:[ALT+TAB] on Windows and GNU/Linux, or kbd:[⌘+TAB]
on MacOS. Also, use the kbd:[↑] (up arrow) to repeat commands on the command
line without typing them again.

Using the app switching shortcut on a Windows or GNU/Linux machine, the
edit-test dance becomes:

. Edit the source code.
. kbd:[ALT+TAB] to go to the terminal/console.
. kbd:[↑] to repeat the previous `go run forever.go` without typing it again.
. kbd:[ENTER] to run the command.
. kbd:[ALT+TAB] to go back to the editor.

In a short time you'll be good at this dance. The next exercise should help.

==== Samigraphic patterns

[[assorted-draw-chars]] are called semigraphic characters because they were used
to make drawings in text-only computer displays. We could not control each
screen pixel (each dot on the screen), but only use predefined characters. So
some characters were provided just for drawing.

For example: The last two characters above look like the slash `/` and backslash `\`
but they are actually called
https://runefinder2018.appspot.com/?q=box+diagonal["box diagonal"]. The box
diagonals connect to the corners of the character cells, creating continuous
patterns. If your terminal cannot display those characters, use the regular
slashes `/` and `\`.

===== A few patterns with two characters

Replace the name `"J. Random Hacker"` from example XXX with one of these
combinations:

----
"╱╲"
"╱╲╱"
"╱ ╱╲ "
